# KAGGLE COMPETITIONS

Kaggle Competitions is a collection of solutions to various competitions hosted on Kaggle. The following competition were tried:

1. Titanic: ML from disaster
2. Digit Recognizer 
3. DOTA Winner Prediction 

## 1. Titanic: ML from disaster
In this challenge, we had to complete an analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive in the most infamous shipwreck (the sinking of RMS Titanic). A simple neural network is put to work to predict which passengers survived the tragedy. All the passenger data has been provided.

### Details 
Some feature engineering was employed to gain further insights into the dataset. Some new features such as CallSign, Surname, SameSurname and SameTicket were generated using the original features. 
The complete detail about the competition is provided at "https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic".
